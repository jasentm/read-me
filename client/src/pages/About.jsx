            Read Me was designed to be a Tarot Card Reading Application that allows users to learn the joys, wonders, and intricacies of reading Tarot Cards.
            <br /><br />Due to the fact that the original version of the Riderâ€“Waite Tarot (illustrated by "Pixie" aka Pamela Coleman Smith) is in the public domain in all countries that have a copyright term of 70 years or fewer after the death of the last co-author, that is the deck used by this site.
            <br /><br />However, it is imperative to note that the Rider-Waite deck was published over 100 years ago and is inherently steeped in heteronormativity and monarchistic hierarchy.  It is, therefore, vital to look past the meanings derived from the published booklet to more inclusive and varied meanings.
