# Read Me ðŸ”®
Join us in the techno-mystica: Learn how to read tarot cards through fun, interactive, and effective lessons, view any card at any time to refresh your memory on its meaning, and get your own tarot card readings.

---

## Introduction
- A user can log in to view their own personal progress/profile (and stay logged in with Flask-Login)
- A user can take dynamically generated lessons to expand their learning with reading tarot cards
- A user can view all tarot cards and learn more about each one
- A user can get a three-card reading and save it to their profile to view later


## Stretch Goals
- Add music
- Add Celtic Cross Spread as a reading a user can get
- Integrate AI for a more "human" reading
- Expand lessons to include difficulty levels, multiple types of input, and varied questions
- Game elements (deck builder, RPG, "side quests" to learn about individual cards)
- Some type of narrative structure
- Something hidden and fun for users to find (color changer, about page, a small game?)
